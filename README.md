# OpenCV_training
Trying to learn some OpenCV through tutorials, most of the mini projects here are based on "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQeoO7MI0Bs",
much are written in a similar fashion as it was modeled by it. Some functions have been added, like the ability to save selected colors to a file and single them out
for usage in webcam canvas.
